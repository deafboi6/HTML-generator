# HTML-generator

## Description

This is a small team generator meant to help a manager of a team create unique cards for each member of their team (including themselves!) to help with visibility of their team as well as ease of access to useful information about each member.

This application uses node.js to run an inquirer prompt that leads the user through creating their by asking relevent questions and allowing some flexibility to each member.

Once the questions have all been answered, a simple and easy to read HTML file is generated that presents each member in clean, easily readable cards.

## Installation

Simply download the repository, run "npm i" in the terminal (make sure you are in your new folder when you run this!), then run "node.js". After that, follow the prompts until you're done making employees. Finally, open the index.html file!
